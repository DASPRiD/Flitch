Flitch - PHP coding standard validator
=====================================

Flitch will scan through your source files and detect coding standard violations. 
Currently it ships with ZF2 as core standard, but can be extended by custom
standards. Those standards should be located in the directory .flitch/standards
in your home directory.

For command line options, run flitch --help
