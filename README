Flitch - PHP coding standard validator
======================================

About
-----
Flitch is a coding standard validator for PHP, meant as a replacement for
PHPCS. It is partly based on PHPca <https://github.com/spriebsch/phpca> by
Stefan Priebsch, but should not be confused with a fork of it.

Flitch will scan through your source files and detect coding standard
violations. Currently it ships with ZF2 as core standard, but can be extended
by custom standards.

Why replace PHPCS?
------------------
Since this question came up a few times already, here is a list of reasons:

- PHPCS is known to be a memory hog.
- It is not trivial to write complex rules for PHPCS.
- It is complicated to write unit tests for rules.
- There are bug reports open since 2008.
- Flitch is written completly modular, so it can be reused in other
  applications.

Adding custom standards
-----------------------
Custom standards should be located in the directory .flitch/standards
in your home directory.

Installation
------------
To install Flitch, simply clone it with git. Additionally you can symlink the
"flitch" executable to a directory in your PATH.

Using Flitch
------------
For command line options, run flitch --help
